**Why use Open Source licensing?** = Open Source Innovation originated in the USA’s automobile and computer sectors (Ford and IBM), which provided economic advantages by accelerating sector wide innovation via open patent transactions.  The economic advantages of building cars and computers with fewer transactional costs is defined by 1991 Noble Prize winner in economics Ronald Coase.  By comparison the Australin building industry continues to use standards which predate modern economics and is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the country.

# Service Level Agreement for Earthsteading Building Surveying Ltd.

The scope of work which Earthsteading Building Surveying is responsible for (as authorised by the Building Act 1993 and the Building Regulations 2018) is to assure compliance of your building with the National Construction Code.  This includes: 
  - [ ] (i) assessing your building permit applications for compliance, 
  - [ ] (ii) issuing building permits, 
  - [ ] (iii) conducting building inspections at mandatory notification stages, 
  - [ ] (iv) providing directions to fix non-compliant building work (including serving building orders and notices), 
  - [ ] (v) providing certificates of final inspection, and (vi) issuing occupancy permits.

The fixed base cost of the above service is N% of the total build cost for the building (which an authorised bank must provide a statement of available funds for assurance).  The base cost of this service _must be paid in advance_ prior to assessing your building permit application for compliance.

Additional flexible costs which are NOT included in the above fixed base cost include: (a) travel expenses for the minimum 5x inspections (traveling from Melbourne CBD round-trip), (b) additional inspections if design schematics are altered and/or inspections failed, (c) if additional compliance documentation is required such as engineering/civil work reports and/or Performance Solutions, and/or (d) additional work required by change/additions of the build team and/or designer.  The above flexible costs will be discussed with the builder-owner prior to commencing flexible cost works.

The tentative timelines for the above services (as discussed in our introductory briefing) will be provided.

The build timelines are subject to change and will be reviewed with the builder-owner at each stage of the build to agree adjustments.

As the builder-owner, I agree to the above Service Level Agreement and appoint Earthsteading as my Building Surveyor for the duration of my build project.  

I have read the Earthsteading code of conduct and I'm aware of the complaints procedure and contracting process as outlined at [Earthsteading contracting procedures](https://github.com/earthsteading/contracting-procedures)
